# Material Parser and Reactions Extractor

The package consists of two modules:

 * Material Parser: class to extract composition of a given material
 * Recipe Extractor: wrapping class on Material Parser

**Material Parser** processes one material entity per run, and allows for:

 * parsing material string into composition,
 * constructing dictionary of materials abbreviations,
 * finding values of stoichiometric and elements variables,
 * splitting mixtures/composites/alloys/solid solutions into compounds
 * reconstructing chemical formula from chemical name

**Recipe Extractor** is a wrapper on top of Material Parser.
It combines methods from Material Parser class into pipeline to build recipe: targets and their precursors.
As an input it uses list of materials found in abstract and synthesis paragraph together with the corresponsing text sentences.
It is specifically designed for the output and purposes of our project.
However, it can serve as an example of Material Parser usage.

**Recipe Extractor** does the following:

 * uses text sentences to build abbreviation vocabulary for all abbreviation found in materials list
 * resolves abbreviations in materials list (substitute formula instead of abbreviation)
 * if targets list is empty, uses targets from abstract
 * obtains materials compositions
 * substitutes values of stoichiometric and elements parameters

Matching of elements and constructing list of unbalanced reaction are suppressed after version 3
 
### Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/CederGroupHub/MaterialParser.git
cd MaterialParser
pip install -r requirements.txt -e .
```

### Initilization:
```
from material_parser import MaterialParser
mp = MaterialParser(verbose=False, pubchem_lookup=False, fails_log=False)

from recipe_extractor import recipe_extractor
rex = RecipeExtractor()
```

### Material parser

#### Initialization

 ```
 verbose: <bool> print supplemental information
 pubchem_lookup: <bool> look for unknown chemical names in PubChem (not implemented, slows down computations significantly)

 ```
